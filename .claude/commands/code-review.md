## Code Review Rules

Review the pull request specified by the PR number provided in the command arguments.

Usage: `/code-review <PR_NUMBER>`
Example: `/code-review 001`

The PR number will be available as `$ARGUMENTS`.

Review process:

**IMPORTANT: When investigating existing files or code, you MUST use serena. Using serena reduces token consumption by 60-80% and efficiently retrieves necessary information through semantic search capabilities.**

1. **Get PR information:** Use the github cli ( `gh pr view $arguments`) to get the pr details.
2. **Explore changes:** Use "gh pr diff $arguments" to check for code changes.
3. **Do code review:** Check the details of the PR and perform a code review.
4. **Run review:** Perform code reviews according to `Important Guidelines for Write a Comment`".
5. **Report review results** Instead of using something like create pull_request_review, save the review results in `.tmp`. Add a comment to a line that has improvements or concerns. If revisions are clear, use the suggestions proactively.

**Important Guidelines for Writing Comments**

- **Inline Comment Structure:**

  - **Leave with conclusion:** Use the one-line summary of the main point to write code differences, number of lines, filenames and review content.
  - **Reasoning and suggestions:** After the conclusion, provide detailed explanation of your reasoning, background, and specific suggestions.
  - **Focus on issues:** Inline comments should focus on specific improvements like bug fixes, potential bugs, or readability issues.

- **Regarding Positive Feedback:**

  - **Be selective inline:** Only mention exceptional design choices or innovative implementations that other developers can learn from.
  - **Summarize positives:** Consolidate overall positive aspects and general impressions in the summary comment when submitting the review.

- **Review Format**
  - **Write a review in Markdown**: Save the review results to `.tmp`.
  - **Write a review in Japanese**: Please write code reviews in the format below.
